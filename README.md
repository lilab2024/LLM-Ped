# LLM-Ped
Using Large Language Models to Identify and Explain Risk Factors for Driver Yielding at Unsignalized Pedestrian Crosswalks

# Project Overview
The code includes:

**· Prompt for GPT-4o/GPT-4omini** : including relevant domain knowledge, thinking guidance, few-shot prompting, multimodal prompting

**· Prompt for Deepseek-V3/Deepseek-R1** : including relevant domain knowledge, thinking guidance, few-shot prompting.

**· Ablation experiment** : We perform the ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of each key component of the proposed framework using the Minnesota driver–pedestrian dataset. 

# Datasets
This study draws on the open source Minnesota driver pedestrian dataset documented  comprising 3,314 interactions recorded at 18 unsignalised intersections. These sites were specifically chosen in collaboration with the Minnesota Department of Transportation to ensure a diverse representation of traffic volumes, land use contexts, and intersection geometries.
